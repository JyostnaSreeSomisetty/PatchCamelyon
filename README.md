GitHub Repo for our Applied Machine Learning Final Project

Worked with and helped lead a team of 5 students to a grade of 100% over the course of a 6 week final project where we built 3 different kinds of machine learning models, analyzed the data and our models and more
Results and Model Comparison: -
CNN Model:
This model performs terribly, failing to categorize any positive examples accurately and showing neither true nor false positives. As a result, the F1 score is unknown and both precision and recall are zero.

TF Model:

With an accuracy of 0.5154, the TF model demonstrates moderate performance and accurately classifies about 51.54% of the occurrences. The comparatively low F1 score of 0.4127 is the consequence of its precision and recall values of 0.5234 and 0.3407, respectively, indicating that while it correctly recognizes some positive cases, it misses a large fraction of them.

Attention Model:

With more accuracy (0.5984), precision (0.6076), recall (0.5552), and F1 score (0.5802) than the TF model, the Attention model performs better. These scores imply that the Attention model maintains an acceptable balance between precision and recall, while better capturing positive events.

Dense Net Model:

With an accuracy of 0.8057, precision of 0.8640, recall of 0.7266, and F1 score of 0.7894, the Dense Net model performs the best out of all the models. These measurements show that the Dense Net model performs better overall since it is very good at correctly categorizing positive cases and minimizing false positives.

Team Mates included Carl, Sasanka, Emiliya, Keerthana
